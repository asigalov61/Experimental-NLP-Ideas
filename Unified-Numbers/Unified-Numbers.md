Draft

This is a proposal for the fundamental/core mathematics as well as for the theoretical/experimental mathematics

1) Axiom: Sum of all numbers = G

2) Each number(pr) is represented as t(pa, pr, fu), where t = time, pa = pr-pa, and fu = rand(pa-pr, pr, pa+pr)
NOTE: fu representation can be improved or extended (probably to infinity)

3) Full proposed equation is therefore sum(G) = t(pa, pr, fu)

Python code is elementary so I will add it later

PRO TIP for simulation/implementation:

1) Either limit G to get ad infinitum resolution on 1 specific number
2) Limit everything to a specific value to get a specific resolution on a specific number
3) Most likely it is best to start with primes only as they would allow a good resolution at a sane compute cost
