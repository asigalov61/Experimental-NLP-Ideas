Draft

This is a proposal for the fundamental/core mathematics as well as for the theoretical/experimental mathematics

1) Axiom: Sum of all numbers = G
2) Each number is represented as t(pa, pr, fu), where t = time, pa = pr-pa, and fu = rand(pa-pr, pr, pa+pr)
NOTE: fu representation can improved or extended (probably to infinity)

3) Full proposed equation is therefore sum(G) = t(pa, pr, fu)

Python code is elementary so I will add it later
