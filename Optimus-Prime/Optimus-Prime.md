Optumus Prime NLP Idea for NLP Transformers

Draft

1) Each word is converted to a prime number

2) Each resulting prime is converted to most appropriate sum of whole numbers
NOTE: This may be difiicult or rather tricky

3) Which optimizer to use is not clear but most likely it should be something either prime related or something completely opposite of that (for best results).
NOTE: Traditional stuff should work fine but may produce rather uninteresing results...
